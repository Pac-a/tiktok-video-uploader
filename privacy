#Privacy Policy
Effective Date: March 9th 2025

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles user data. The App is designed to upload and publish videos to TikTok using the official TikTok API.

2. Data Collection and Usage
The App collects and stores TikTok access tokens required to authenticate and authorize video uploads. These tokens are saved securely to allow users to upload videos without needing to re-authenticate for each session.

No additional personal data is collected, and no other sensitive information is stored or processed by the App.

3. Data Retention
Access tokens are stored as long as needed to maintain authentication for video uploads. Users may request deletion of their token at any time by contacting the developer.

4. Data Security
The App implements reasonable security measures to protect stored access tokens from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, as with any system, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

5. Third Parties
The App does not share any user data with third parties. Data is used solely for interacting with the TikTok API to provide the video upload functionality.

6. Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
